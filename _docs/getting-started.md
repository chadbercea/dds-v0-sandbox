# Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to v0.dev and connect your GitHub account
3. Select your forked repository as your project
4. Start generating components - they'll automatically use Docker Design System!

## Need a Fresh Start?
If you want to start over:
1. Delete your forked repository from GitHub
2. Fork this repository again
3. Reconnect to v0.dev with your new fork

It's like getting a fresh canvas while keeping all the Docker Design System goodness!

ðŸ’Ž That's it! The Docker Design System tokens are ready to use in your v0.dev project.

# Working with Multiple Projects

## Option 1: Multiple Forks (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Rename your current fork to something meaningful (e.g., `dds-v0-marketing-components`)
2. Fork `dds-v0-sandbox` again for your new project
3. Now you have:
   - Your project preserved with a meaningful name
   - A fresh sandbox for new experiments

## Option 2: Branching Workflow (For More Advanced Users)
1. In your fork, create a new branch for your successful work (e.g., `project/marketing-components`)
2. Push that branch to preserve it
3. Return to main branch for new experiments
4. Each successful project can live in its own branch

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Use descriptive names for your forks or branches like:
- `dds-v0-team-name`
- `dds-v0-project-name`
- `dds-v0-buildcloud-usage-charts`
- `dds-v0-adminconsole-nav-experiment`
