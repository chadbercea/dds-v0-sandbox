# DDS + v0.dev Sandbox

This is a sandbox project to test how the Docker Design System can be consumed inside [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) via tokens, global styles, and ShadCN components.

## ðŸ§ª Purpose

- Validate token-driven UI generation with v0
- Use `globals.css` to inject CSS variables from DDS tokens
- Scaffold pages/components using v0 prompts
- Ensure downstream forks inherit Docker UI styles by default

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Go to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)** and connect your GitHub account
3. **Select your forked repository** as your project
4. **Start generating components** â€” theyâ€™ll automatically use the Docker Design System

## ðŸ“¦ Includes

- ShadCN component library (pre-tokenized)
- `globals.css` with CSS variables from DDS tokens
- Example pages and components (soon)
