# 🎨 Docker Design System Token Pipeline (v0.dev Sandbox)

This repository demonstrates a groundbreaking proof-of-concept for automating design system implementation through AI-driven development. It showcases a complete token pipeline from Figma to production, with AI-assisted component generation that respects Docker's design system.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Automated Token Pipeline**: Transform Figma design tokens into multiple target formats
  - Style Dictionary transformation pipeline
  - shadcn/ui theme variables
  - CSS custom properties
  - MUI theme generation
  - Automated deployment to Vercel

- **AI Design System Integration**
  - v0.dev integration with Docker design tokens
  - AI-driven component generation respecting brand guidelines
  - Consistent design system implementation

- **Multi-Platform Support**
  - Vercel deployment
  - Storybook integration
  - Cross-framework compatibility

## 🌐 Live Demo

Check out the live deployment at [v0-ai-design-system](https://v0-ai-design-system-git-hello-wo-35357d-chads-projects-c609126e.vercel.app/)

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.2.4
- **UI**: React 19 + shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **Design Tokens**: Style Dictionary
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

This proof-of-concept demonstrates the automated pipeline from Docker Design System tokens to AI-powered implementation. Here's how to explore and test the system:

### 1. Explore the Live Demo
Visit our [live deployment](https://v0-ai-design-system-git-hello-wo-35357d-chads-projects-c609126e.vercel.app/) to see the Docker Design System tokens in action:
- View component examples
- Test responsive behaviors
- Verify design system compliance

### 2. Test with v0.dev
To test the Docker Design System integration with v0.dev:
1. Visit [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
2. Use our deployed token endpoint
3. Generate components that automatically respect Docker's design system

### 3. Review Token Implementation
Examine how the tokens are implemented:
- Check `app/globals.css` for the transformed design tokens
- Review component theming in the UI library
- Inspect the automated style implementation

### 4. Verify Cross-Platform Compatibility
Our tokens work across multiple platforms:
- Web components (Live demo)
- Storybook instances
- v0.dev generations
- Design tool previews

## 📦 Project Structure

- `app/globals.css` - Docker Design System foundation tokens
- `components/` - UI component library
- `styles/` - Additional styling configurations
- `public/` - Static assets and Docker illustrations

## 🔄 Token Pipeline Flow

1. **Design Tokens (Figma)**
   - Export design tokens as JSON

2. **Token Transformation (Style Dictionary)**
   - Process and transform tokens
   - Generate multiple format outputs

3. **Framework Integration**
   - shadcn/ui theme variables
   - CSS custom properties
   - MUI theme configuration

4. **AI Implementation (v0.dev)**
   - AI-driven component generation
   - Design system compliance
   - Automated implementation

5. **Deployment**
   - Automated Vercel deployment
   - Live production environment

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Design System teams automating token implementation
- Organizations integrating AI while maintaining brand consistency
- Teams bridging the design-to-development gap
- Cross-platform design system deployment
